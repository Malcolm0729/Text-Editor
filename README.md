# Text-Editor

## Description

Given the code for a text editor, I was able to create this application as a download and just a normal website. I can create a double version of the text-editor to be downloaded as a PWA. Babel let's the app use ES6 syntax on older ES5 browsers. With the use of IDB we also have persisting data whether we decide to run the app, online or offline and though the browser or on the PWA.
